LATENCY=Latency
LATENCY.description=Groups of Instances with high performance requirements for a specific user request.
AGGREGATES=Consistency Constraint
AGGREGATES.description=A group of Instances that have a dependent state and therefore need to be kept consistent to each other.
SHARED_OWNER_GROUPS=Shared Owner
SHARED_OWNER_GROUPS.description=Same Entity is responsible for a group of Instances. Service decomposition should try to keep entities with the same responsible role together while not mixing entities with different responsible instances in one service.
PREDEFINED_SERVICES=Predefined Service
PREDEFINED_SERVICES.description=Instances forcefully need to be modeled in the same service
SEPERATED_SECURITY_ZONESt=Security Constraint
SEPERATED_SECURITY_ZONES.description=Groups of Instances are semantically related but must not reside in the same service in order to satisfy information security requirements. 
SECURITY_ACCESS_GROUPS=Security Contexuality
SECURITY_ACCESS_GROUPS.description=A security role is allowed to see or process a group of Instances. Mixing security contexts in one service complicates authentication and authorization implementations.
COMPATIBILITY_STRUCTURAL_VOLATILITY=Structural Volatility
COMPATIBILITY_STRUCTURAL_VOLATILITY.description=How often change requests need to be implemented affecting Instances.
COMPATIBILITY_CONSISTENCY_CRITICALITY=Consistency Criticality
COMPATIBILITY_CONSISTENCY_CRITICALITY.description= Some data such as financial records loses its value in case of inconsistencies while other data is more tolerant to inconsistencies.
COMPATIBILITY_AVAILABILITY_CRITICALITY=Availability Criticality
COMPATIBILITY_AVAILABILITY_CRITICALITY.description=Instances have varying availability constraints. Some are critical while others can be unavailable for some time. As providing high availability comes at a cost, Instances classified with different characteristics should not be composed in the same service
COMPATIBILITY_CONTENT_VOLATILITY=Content Volatility
COMPATIBILITY_CONTENT_VOLATILITY.description=A Instance can be classified by its volatility which defines how frequent it is updated.
COMPATIBILITY_STORAGE_SIMILARITY=Storage Similarity
COMPATIBILITY_STORAGE_SIMILARITY.description=Storage that is required to persist all instances of a Instance.
COMPATIBILITY_SECURITY_CRITICALITY=Security Criticality
COMPATIBILITY_SECURITY_CRITICALITY.description=Criticality of an Instance in case of data loss or a privacy violation.
